# live-voting
Voting extension for live vide streams, such as live shows, live theaters or any live stream.

This is the original source code that was used in the first live theatre played in 2 May 2020 in https://neu.schauspielhaus.ch/de/journal/18109/dekalog-6-gebot. About 250 people watched it live.

The source code includes a websocket server written in Nodejs and an admin panel for managing voting options along with the voting buttons, that can be injected via iframe into any external webpage.
